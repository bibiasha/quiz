This React-based quiz application provides an interactive user experience for answering multiple-choice questions across various tests. Here's a brief breakdown of the key features:

Test and Question Navigation:

The app supports multiple tests, and users can navigate between questions and tests.
Users can move between questions using "Next" and "Previous" buttons, and can also switch between different tests with the "Next Test" and "Previous Test" buttons.
Question and Options:

Each question is displayed with a list of options. When a user selects an answer, it is highlighted, and if the explanation for the question is enabled, the correct answer is shown with a visual cue (green check or red X).
Answer Selection and Feedback:

When a user selects an answer, it highlights the selected option, and after submitting the answer, the correct answer is shown.
An "Explanation" button is available to display a detailed explanation of the answer, with color-coded feedback for correct (green) or incorrect (red) answers.
Test Management:

The app manages multiple tests, showing a button for each test to allow users to select and switch between them.
The test navigation ensures that users can proceed through all the available tests, preventing access to tests beyond the available range.
Loading State:

The app displays a loading spinner while fetching available tests and questions from the API.
Visual and Responsive Design:

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and responsive layout.
The quiz interface includes visually distinct buttons for navigation and help, as well as visual feedback on answers and explanations.
This setup provides a well-structured, intuitive interface for users to take quizzes, select answers, view explanations, and navigate through tests seamlessly.
